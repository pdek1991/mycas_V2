Recommendations for a Secure, Highly Available, Extensible, and Reliable Kubernetes Application

1. Security Enhancements:

Enforce Pod Security Admission (PSA) with restricted policies.

Use Kyverno/OPA to enforce policies like image signing and resource limits.

Implement Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd) to secure service-to-service communication.

Deploy eBPF-based observability (Cilium) for advanced network security.



2. Scalability & Availability:

Use Cluster Autoscaler to dynamically scale nodes.

Implement multi-cluster federation to ensure cross-cluster failover.

Improve database HA setup (MySQL Galera, PostgreSQL Patroni).



3. Observability & Reliability:

Expand ELK stack for centralized logs and correlation.

Extend Jaeger for full request tracing across microservices.

Use Prometheus & Thanos for long-term metrics storage and visualization.



4. Extensibility & Governance:

Develop CRD Operators for automating tasks.

Improve supply chain security using tools like Sigstore & SLSA.

Use Argo Workflows for complex job orchestration.
